### Overview

The first part of this project focuses on backtesting the Supertrend indicator using historical price data obtained from Yahoo Finance. It allows you to assess the performance of the Supertrend indicator in combination with the Chopiness Index on historical data and gain insights into its effectiveness as a trading tool.

### Features

- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust the Supertrend parameters, such as the ATR period and multiplier, to fine-tune the indicator's behavior.

- **Interactive Candlestick Chart**: The project provides an interactive candlestick chart that displays historical price data along with the indicator signals.

- **Buy/Sell Signals**: Users can visualize buy and sell signals generated by the indicators on the historical data chart.

- **Performance Analysis**: The application allows users to evaluate the indicator's performance by analyzing historical trades and returns.
